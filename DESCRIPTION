Description: This fills the gaps credit analysts and loan modellers at
    Optimum Credit identify in the existing R code body.  It allows for
    the production of documentation with less coding, replicates a number
    of Microsoft Excel functions useful for modelling loans (without
    rounding), and other helpful functions for producing charts and
    tables.  It also has some additional scales for use, including a GBP
    scale.
