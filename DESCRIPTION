Package: optiRum
Title: Financial Functions & More
Description: This fills the gaps credit analysts and loan modellers at
    Optimum Credit identify in the existing R code body.
    It allows for the production of documentation with less coding,
    replicates a number of Microsoft Excel functions useful for
    modelling loans (without rounding), and other helpful functions
    for producing charts and tables.  It also has some additional scales for
    use, including a GBP scale.
