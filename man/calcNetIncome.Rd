submit a pull request on the CSVs in inst/extdata with them filled in.}

\item{modelArgs}{Indicate whether a forward prediction with some 
changing values should be performed, and what scenario values should be
used}

\item{thresholdsTable}{The values needed for calculating various components}

\item{taxRateTable}{The values needed for calculating Income Tax and NI (Class 1 and 4).
